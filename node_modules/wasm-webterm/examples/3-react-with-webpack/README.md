# Example: Run `wasm-webterm` with React using Webpack

This still requires a browser. Webpack will bundle the example for you. It uses the required HTTPS headers to enable web workers.

Run the following commands **inside of this folder** to execute.

```
npm install
```

```
npm run webpack
```

You can now visit https://localhost:4201
