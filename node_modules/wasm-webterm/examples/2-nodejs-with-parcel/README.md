# Example: Run `wasm-webterm` with Node.js using Parcel

This still requires a browser. Parcel will bundle the example for you.

Run the following commands **inside of this folder** to execute.

```
npm install
```

```
npm run parcel
```

You can now visit https://localhost:1234/index.html

## Notes

> You could theoretically also set the required HTTPS headers to make web workers work by using `.proxyrc.json`. But it unfortunately did not work for me while writing this.
