# Examples

This folder contains examples on how you could use `wasm-webterm` in your project.
It also includes WebAssembly binaries for Coreutils and OpenSSL.

Only the [webpack example (3)](./3-react-with-webpack) has enabled HTTPS headers, so it can use web workers.
The examples [1 (directly with http-server)](./1-directly-in-the-browser) and [2 (parcel)](./2-nodejs-with-parcel) have instructions on how you could enable the HTTP headers yourself.
